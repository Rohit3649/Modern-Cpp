Public Override (Common Scenario):

When you declare an overridden function as public in the derived class, it becomes accessible for anyone using an object of the derived class. This is the typical use case for overriding.
The derived class's implementation takes precedence when the object is of the derived type. This allows you to specialize the behavior for derived objects.
Example:

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        std::cout << "Drawing a generic shape\n";
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a circle\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Circle c;
    c.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a circle
}




Private Override (Less Common):

Making an overridden function private in the derived class restricts its access to the derived class itself (and its friend functions if defined). This means you cannot call the overridden function directly from outside the derived class.
This approach is less common but has some specific use cases:
Internal Implementation Detail: You might want to provide an overridden function as an internal implementation detail for the derived class, not exposing it as part of the public interface.
Forced Base Class Interface: In rare cases, you could use a private override to force clients to interact with objects through the base class interface (using a base class pointer or reference), even though the derived class implements the functionality. However, this is generally considered a less desirable approach, and careful design can often achieve the same goal without private overrides.
Example (Illustrative, Not Recommended for Most Cases):

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        std::cout << "Generic animal sound\n";
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
private:
    void makeSound() override { // Private override (not recommended for most cases)
        std::cout << "Meow\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Cat c;
//  c.makeSound(); // This would cause a compile error (cannot access private member)
    Animal* a = &c; // Upcast to base class pointer
    a->makeSound(); // Outputs: Generic animal sound (base class's implementation)
}



Key Points:
Public overrides are the standard way to provide specialized behavior for derived classes.
Private overrides are less common and have specific use cases. Consider if alternative design approaches can achieve your goals without private overrides.
When using a base class pointer or reference, the overridden function called depends on the object's actual type (dynamic binding), not the pointer/reference type (static binding).
